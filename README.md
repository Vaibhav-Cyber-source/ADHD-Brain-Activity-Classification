# ADHD-Brain-Activity-Classification
This project uses fMRI brain imaging, emotional, and socio-demographic data to build a machine learning model that predicts ADHD diagnosis and gender in children and adolescents. Developed for the NHS, it emphasizes fairness, bias mitigation (especially for females), model explainability (SHAP/LIME), and GDPR compliance.
